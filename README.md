# MoPong
Mobile Version of Classic Pong Game for Educational Purpose.

This is the Third in a series of projects for various Pong like games following [PyPong](https://github.com/bguan/pypong) and [Scratch Pong](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/433809822).

This version is implemented using my favorite cross platform mobile development framework [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and the game engine [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/).
